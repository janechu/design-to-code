# JSON schema

## Dialects

Dialects, denoted by the `$schema` key word, have various levels of support. It is the goal of this project to support the most recent drafts and have some capability for backwards compatibility.

## Support

Support is based on the JSON schema [specifications](https://json-schema.org/specification.html) for each dialect. Some key words may be required for the project to accurately interpret the JSON schema.
